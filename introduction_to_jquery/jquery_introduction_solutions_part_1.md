# JQuery Introduction

### 1. What is `jQuery`? What does it enable you to do?

jQuery is a JavaScript library that helps us perform cross-browser compatible DOM manipulation using a shorter syntax. 

### 2. What is the difference between a jQuery object and HTML Element?

A jQuery object has access to all of the functionality of jQuery, including methods like `text` and `each`, while an HTML Element has access to none of these methods. You can only manipulate HTML Elements using vanilla JavaScript; if you want to use jQuery, you'll need to convert your element into a jQuery object first.

### 3. What does the $ represent in jQuery?

$ is an alias for the jQuery function. By wrapping elements or node lists in the jQuery function, you are able to manipulate those elements using jQuery methods.
